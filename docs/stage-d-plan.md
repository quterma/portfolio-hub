- Light / dark theme consistency
- Typography scale (H1 / H2 / H3 / body / muted)
- Semantic spacing tokens (section, stack, card, grid)
- Global container width (reduced desktop max-width)
- Motion rules (durations, easing, reduced-motion support)

**Result:**

- Stable visual baseline
- All further UI work follows these rules
- No visual decisions made “ad hoc”
