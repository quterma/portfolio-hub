# OG Image Placeholder

This directory should contain an `og.png` file (1200x630px) for social media sharing.

To create a proper OG image:

1. Create a 1200x630px image with your portfolio branding
2. Include your name/brand and tagline
3. Use high contrast colors for readability
4. Save as `og.png` in the public directory

For now, you can use any placeholder image or create one using tools like:

- Canva
- Figma
- Photoshop
- Online OG image generators
